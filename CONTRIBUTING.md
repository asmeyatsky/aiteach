Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
- Explanation of why this enhancement would be useful
- Examples of how the enhancement would work

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

## üèó Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Python 3.9+

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
python -m pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
flutter test
```

## üì• Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you

## üìù Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public methods and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### Frontend (Flutter/Dart)
- Follow Flutter style guide
- Use meaningful widget names
- Keep widgets small and focused
- Use const constructors where possible
- Prefer stateless widgets over stateful widgets when possible

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report
- Check the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported

### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

1. **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem
2. **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible
3. **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
4. **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior
5. **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
6. **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem
7. **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below

## üí° Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
- Check the existing issues to see if the enhancement has already been suggested
- Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in

### How Do I Submit A Good Enhancement Suggestion?
