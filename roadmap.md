# AI Education Platform: Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the AI Education Platform, a multi-platform application for iOS, Android, and the web.

---

### **Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Architecture**

This phase is about laying a robust groundwork for the entire platform.

*   **1.1. API Specification:**
    *   **Tooling:** Use OpenAPI (Swagger) for documenting the API.
    *   **Design:** Define all API endpoints, request/response models (using Pydantic in FastAPI), and status codes. This will include endpoints for:
        *   **Users:** `POST /register`, `POST /login`, `GET /me`, `PUT /me`
        *   **Courses:** `GET /courses`, `GET /courses/{id}`
        *   **Lessons:** `GET /courses/{id}/lessons`, `GET /lessons/{id}`, `POST /lessons/{id}/complete`
        *   **Forum:** `GET /posts`, `POST /posts`, `GET /posts/{id}`, `POST /posts/{id}/comments`
        *   **Gamification:** `GET /me/profile`, `GET /badges`
*   **1.2. Database Schema Design:**
    *   **Tooling:** Use a database diagramming tool (like dbdiagram.io) to visualize the schema.
    *   **Tables:**
        *   `users`: `id`, `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `profile_picture_url`, `created_at`
        *   `courses`: `id`, `title`, `description`, `tier`, `thumbnail_url`
        *   `lessons`: `id`, `course_id`, `title`, `content_type` (text, video, quiz), `content_data`, `order`
        *   `user_progress`: `user_id`, `lesson_id`, `completed_at`
        *   `forum_posts`: `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `body`, `created_at`
        *   `forum_comments`: `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `body`, `created_at`
        *   `badges`: `id`, `name`, `description`, `icon_url`
        *   `user_badges`: `user_id`, `badge_id`, `awarded_at`
*   **1.3. Project Scaffolding & Setup:**
    *   Initialize a Python project with a virtual environment.
    *   Install dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2-binary`, `passlib`, `python-jose`.
    *   Create a structured directory layout (`/app`, `/app/routers`, `/app/models`, `/app/schemas`, `/app/db`).
*   **1.4. Authentication & Security:**
    *   Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and validation for secure, stateless authentication.
    *   Implement password hashing using a strong algorithm like bcrypt.
    *   Set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies to allow the Flutter app to communicate with the backend.
*   **1.5. Containerization:**
    *   Write a `Dockerfile` for the FastAPI application.
    *   Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the local development environment, including the backend service and a PostgreSQL database service.

### **Phase 2: Core App Structure (Flutter)**

This phase focuses on building the skeleton of the Flutter application.

*   **2.1. Project Initialization:**
    *   Install the Flutter SDK and set up the development environment for iOS, Android, and web.
    *   Create a new Flutter project.
*   **2.2. Architecture & State Management:**
    *   Implement a scalable state management solution. I'll use **Riverpod**, which is a robust and flexible choice.
    *   Structure the app into layers: `data` (repositories, API services), `domain` (business logic, models), and `presentation` (UI, screens, widgets).
*   **2.3. Theming & UI Kit:**
    *   Define a comprehensive theme: color palette, typography, button styles, and input field decorations.
    *   Create a "UI kit" of reusable custom widgets (e.g., `PrimaryButton`, `CourseCard`, `LessonListItem`) to ensure UI consistency.
*   **2.4. Navigation:**
    *   Use a declarative routing package like `go_router` to manage navigation.
    *   Define all the app routes and the parameters they accept (e.g., `/course/{courseId}`).
*   **2.5. API Integration Layer:**
    *   Use the `dio` package to create a dedicated API service for handling all HTTP requests to the backend.
    *   Implement error handling, request retries, and serialization/deserialization of JSON data.

### **Phase 3: MVP Feature Implementation**

This is where the application comes to life.

*   **3.1. User Authentication Flow:**
    *   Build the UI for the registration, login, and "forgot password" screens.
    *   Connect the UI to the backend authentication endpoints.
    *   Implement secure storage for the JWT on the device.
*   **3.2. Curriculum & Learning Experience:**
    *   **Course Catalog:** Build a screen that fetches and displays all available courses.
    *   **Course Details:** Create a screen that shows the lessons for a selected course and the user's progress.
    *   **Lesson View:** Develop the lesson viewer to handle different content types (text, video embeds, quizzes).
    *   **Progress Tracking:** Implement the logic to mark lessons as complete and update the UI accordingly.
*   **3.3. Community Forum:**
    *   **Post List:** Build a screen that displays a list of all forum posts.
    *   **Post Creation:** Create a form for users to write and submit new posts.
    *   **Post Details & Comments:** Build a screen to view a single post and its comments, and a form to add new comments.
*   **3.4. Gamification & User Profile:**
    *   **Profile Screen:** Create a user profile screen that displays their name, points, and earned badges.
    *   **Gamification Engine:** Implement the backend logic to award points and badges for actions like completing a course, posting in the forum, or achieving a daily streak.

### **Phase 4: Polish, Deployment, & Testing**

This phase is about preparing the application for the public.

*   **4.1. Platform-Specific Refinements:**
    *   **Mobile:** Test on a wide range of iOS and Android devices. Adapt UI elements to feel native on each platform (e.g., using Material widgets on Android and Cupertino widgets on iOS where appropriate).
    *   **Web:** Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on all major browsers. Optimize for performance using tools like Lighthouse.
*   **4.2. Backend Deployment:**
    *   Provision a production-grade PostgreSQL database (e.g., Amazon RDS).
    *   Deploy the containerized FastAPI application to a scalable cloud service (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Google Cloud Run).
    *   Configure environment variables and secrets for the production environment.
*   **4.3. Frontend Deployment:**
    *   **Web:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy the Flutter web app to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting or AWS S3/CloudFront.
    *   **Mobile:** Use a CI/CD service like Codemagic or GitHub Actions with Fastlane to automate the build and release process for the iOS and Android apps.
*   **4.4. Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Write tests for the backend API endpoints and business logic.
    *   **Widget & Integration Tests:** Write tests for the Flutter UI components and user flows.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Perform manual or automated E2E tests to ensure the entire system works as expected.
*   **4.5. App Store Submission:**
    *   Create the necessary assets (app icons, screenshots, promotional text).
    *   Complete the app store listings on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
    *   Submit the apps for review.
